    <h1>NASA's Ingenuity Helicopter</h1><br>
  </center>
  <div class="center">
    <p align="justify">The Mars Helicopter, Ingenuity, is a small, autonomous aircraft that will be carried to the surface of the Red Planet attached to the belly of the Perseverance rover. Its mission is experimental in nature and completely
      independent of the rover’s science mission. In the months after landing, the helicopter will be placed on the surface to test – for the first time ever – powered flight in the thin Martian air. Its performance during these experimental test
      flights will help inform decisions relating to considering small helicopters for future Mars missions, where they could perform in a support role as robotic scouts, surveying terrain from above, or as full standalone science craft carrying
      instrument payloads. Taking to the air would give scientists a new perspective on a region’s geology and even allow them to peer into areas that are too steep or slippery to send a rover. In the distant future, they might even help astronauts
      explore Mars.<br> <br>

      The project is solely a demonstration of technology; it is not designed to support the Mars 2020/Perseverance mission, which is searching for signs of ancient life and collecting samples of rock and sediment in tubes for potential return to
      Earth
      by later missions.<br> <br>
 <h1>3D Model</h1>
 <iframe src="https://mars.nasa.gov/gltf_embed/25043" width="100%" height="450px" frameborder="0"  style="border-radius:0.8rem;"></iframe><br><br>
    <h2>Key Objectives</h2><br>
    <p>
      • Prove powered flight in the thin atmosphere of Mars. The Red Planet has lower gravity (about one- third that of Earth) but its atmosphere is just 1% as thick, making it much harder to generate lift.<br>
      • Demonstrate miniaturized flying technology. That requires shrinking down onboard computers, elec- tronics and other parts so that the helicopter is light enough to take off.<br>
      • Operate autonomously. Ingenuity will use solar power to charge its batteries and rely on internal heaters to maintain operational temperatures during the cold Martian nights. After receiving commands from Earth relayed through the rover, each
      test flight is performed without real-time input from Mars Helicopter mission controllers.<br><br>
    </p>
    <h2>Dimensions</h2><br>
    <p>• Height: about 19 inches (0.49 meters)<br><br></p>
    <h2>Key Features</h2><br><iframe src="https://mars.nasa.gov/layout/embed/video/?v=476" width="640" height="370" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="float:right; border-radius:0.8rem;"></iframe>
    <p>
      • Weighs 4 pounds (1.8 kg)<br>
      • Solar-powered and recharges on its own<br>
      • Wireless communication system<br>
      • Counter-rotating blades spin about 2,400 rpm<br>
      • Equipped with computers, navigation sensors, and two cameras (one color and one black-and-white)<br><br>
    </p>
    <h2>Program Management</h2><br>
    <p>The Mars 2020 Project and Mars Helicopter Technology Demonstration are managed for NASA’s Science Mission Directorate, Washington, by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), a division of Caltech in Southern California.At NASA Headquarters, David
      Lavery is the program executive for the Mars Helicopter. At JPL, MiMi Aung is the Mars Helicopter project manager and J. (Bob) Balaram is chief engineer.<br><br>
      • Rotor system span: about 4 feet (1.2 meters)<br><br><br>

      NASA’s Ingenuity Mars Helicopter takes off and lands in this video captured on April 25, 2021, by Mastcam-Z, an imager aboard NASA’s Perseverance Mars rover. As expected, the helicopter flew out of its field of vision while completing a flight plan that took it 164 feet (50 meters) downrange of the landing spot. Keep watching, the helicopter will return to stick the landing. The Ingenuity Mars Helicopter was built by JPL, which also manages this technology demonstration project for NASA Headquarters. It is supported by NASA’s Science Mission Directorate, Aeronautics Research Mission Directorate, and Space Technology Mission Directorate. NASA’s Ames Research Center and Langley Research Center provided significant flight performance analysis and technical assistance during Ingenuity’s development. <br><br>

A key objective for Perseverance’s mission on Mars is astrobiology, including the search for signs of ancient microbial life. The rover will characterize the planet’s geology and past climate, pave the way for human exploration of the Red Planet, and be the first mission to collect and cache Martian rock and regolith (broken rock and dust). Subsequent NASA missions, in cooperation with ESA (European Space Agency), would send spacecraft to Mars to collect these sealed samples from the surface and return them to Earth for in-depth analysis. <br><br>

The Mars 2020 Perseverance mission is part of NASA’s Moon to Mars exploration approach, which includes Artemis missions to the Moon that will help prepare for human exploration of the Red Planet. JPL, which is managed for NASA by Caltech in Pasadena, California, built and manages operations of the Perseverance rover.
